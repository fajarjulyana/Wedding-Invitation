# Wedding Invitation Generator

This is a simple web application that allows users to create personalized wedding invitations. The app lets users input wedding details, upload photos, and choose a design for the invitation. Each wedding invitation is given a unique URL based on the couple's name.

## Features

- **Customizable Invitations**: Users can enter wedding details like couple names, wedding date, time, location, and RSVP date.
- **Photo Upload**: Users can upload up to 7 pre-wedding photos to be displayed on the invitation.
- **Design Selection**: Users can choose from multiple invitation designs (e.g., minimalistic or elegant).
- **Unique Invitation Links**: Each couple's invitation is given a unique URL based on their names.
- **Admin Panel**: Admin users can view all created invitations and navigate to any invitation via its unique link.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **File Uploads**: Multer
- **Database**: SQLite (for storing invitations)
- **Frontend**: HTML templates for the invitation designs

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone this 
cd wedding-invitation-generator
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up the database:

The app uses an SQLite database, and the database will be automatically created when you run the app for the first time.

### 4. Run the application:

```bash
node app.js
```

The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

   - Submit the form to generate a unique invitation link.

### 2. **View Invitations**:
   - After submitting the form, you’ll be redirected to the unique URL for the couple's wedding invitation.
   - The invitation will be displayed with the chosen design and uploaded photos.

### 3. **Admin Panel**:
   - To view all created invitations, go to `http://localhost:3000/admin`.
   - The admin panel lists all invitations with links to view each one.

    /uploads         (Uploaded wedding photos)
    /css             (CSS styles for the invitation)

```

## Customizing Templates

You can customize the appearance of the invitations by editing the `design-1.html` and `design-2.html` files located in the `/design` folder. Each template file can contain placeholders like `{{coupleName}}`, `{{weddingDate}}`, `{{photoHTML}}`, etc. These placeholders will be replaced with the actual data when rendering the invitation.
